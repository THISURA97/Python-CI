# Python ML project skeleton

This is a customizable project skeleton for a Python based machine learning projects.
You can use this skeleton as a default project template for any Python ML project.

## Project Structure OverviewThe project structure tree is shown below. This structure is designed

in a way to easily develop ML projects. Feedback / PRs are always welcome
about the structure.
